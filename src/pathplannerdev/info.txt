These three folders contain paths intended to be tested on the blue side of the field.
1. Makes the path go the opposite way, hopefully avoiding any flipping.
2. Rotates the robot to look the opposite way.
3. Does both of these at the same time.

When testing, change the blue auto orientation to the direction the robot is facing during the rest of the path.
Drag the items in one of the folders into src/main/deploy/pathplanner/paths to use them. Change anything needed to use them.
